 # The Ontology Kickstarter

The Ontology Kickstarter is a web application which helps you start creating you ontology very quickly. It's like yeoman for ontologies.

While creating an ontology the ontologist determines keywords/key terms which is probably be included in the ontology. Ontologist searches these keywords on this application and presented with relevant entities that have already been defined somewhere on the web.

Ontologist may traverse within results discovering new entities which she never thought before. Ontologist selects the entities which she want to be included in her kickstart ontology, making even the initial ontology is connected with the whole semantic web.

The ontologist processes these results, selects the entities which she wants in her initial ontology and exports them and their connected entities into an ontology format of her desires.

## Research

Ontology reusing is my mSC research subject. I am developing an ontology reusing methodology which will make reusing step more defined and concrete. This tool is being developed to support the new methodology and make it easy to use.

Traversing within results in a creative UI and concept of exporting an ontology in triple basis instead of using the whole ontology are the two key things that this application provides.
